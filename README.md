i write code. i dont always like it,
but thinking im a witch conjuring spells for rock thinking makes it more bearable

i use the kakoune editor, do take a look at it, its quite cool

my project focus is an absolute dice roll, unless you're paying me, you will not receive any form of consistent support for any of my software. good lucck working with this cursed shit
